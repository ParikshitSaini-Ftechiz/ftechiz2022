                        <p>
                            Cloud computing is a method for delivering information technology (IT) services in which
                            resources are retrieved from the Internet through web-based tools and applications, as
                            opposed to a direct connection to a server. Rather than keeping files on a proprietary hard
                            drive or local storage device, cloud-based storage makes it possible to save them to a
                            remote database. As long as an electronic device has access to the web, it has access to the
                            data and the software programs to run it.

                            It's called cloud computing because the information being accessed is found in "the cloud"
                            and does not require a user to be in a specific place to gain access to it. This type of
                            system allows employees to work remotely. Companies providing cloud services enable users to
                            store files and applications on remote servers, and then access all the data via the
                            internet.</p>
